# AukeCoho
This is the development site for an integrated population model for Auke Creek coho salmon. Auke Creek is located near Juneau, Alaska and has been the site of an intensive monitoring project since 1980. A weir positioned near the mouth of the creek allows a near-complete census of adult salmon migrating upstream and juveniles (smolts) migrating downstream. In addition to coho salmon, there are pink, sockeye, and some chum and Chinook.

This is a collaborative project between
