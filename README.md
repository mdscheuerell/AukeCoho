# Background

Auke Creek is located near Juneau, Alaska and has been the site of an intensive monitoring project since 1980. A weir positioned near the mouth of the creek allows a near-complete census of adult salmon migrating upstream and juveniles (smolts) migrating downstream. In addition to coho salmon, there are pink, sockeye, and some chum and Chinook. A subset of both adults and juveniles are sampled for age composition, and all smolts are tagged with a coded wire tag, which are subsequently recovered from the commercial fishery to estimate harvest rates.
